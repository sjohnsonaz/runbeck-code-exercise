# Runbeck Code Exercise

## Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js.  This was tested on version `13.11.0`.
2. Install Typescript globally.  Run `npm install -g typescript`.

## Installation

1. Clone the project into a local folder.
2. Run `npm install`.

## Running

This code contains a RESTful Service, a Single Page Application Client, and a small HTTP Server which will serve all data.  In order to run the project, we must:

1. Build the Service.
2. Build the Client.
3. Run the Service.
4. Run the HTTP Server

For ease of use, there is a single command which does all of this and watches for file changes.

1. Run `npm run watch`.
2. Open and browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001.
3. Example file can be downloaded at http://localhost:3001/example/Example1.txt.
